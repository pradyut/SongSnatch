This project is a full cloud-based media player that is available on the web and on iOS devices. The catalog will be kept consistent across platforms. The application will give the users the option to create and edit play-lists which will also be available cross platform. The app will connect with Facebook and load the user’s friends. This will allow the user to browse their friend’s music catalog.
